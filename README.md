# LinkMarket
LinkMarket is a hybrid marketplace cum social media web application that was created for the Y20 Hackathon at NIT Silchar by team Web Maniacs

## Summary

Marketplace app for small businesses. Similar to Instagram and Facebook like social media, but only circling around products. Two types of users when logging in: business creators and
buyers. Business creators will have the ability to create posts of their products. The entire thing will be similar to social media apps but the domain will be limited to only the promotion of small
businesses. Buyers can follow creators and other buyers just as people follow each other on social media. Collaborative filtering and Content-based filtering will be applied to recommend the right products.
Collaborative filtering is a recommendation algorithm that will recommend products based on the idea that similar kinds of people will prefer similar kinds of products. In a group of friends (a set of
people having a lot of mutual connections among them), it can be assumed that if a product is liked and ordered by one person, it is highly likely that the same product will also be liked by other people
in that group. Content-based filtering recommends products based on the idea that if you liked a product, you are likely to like similar kinds of products or products from the same buyer.
This is how small businesses are going to get more popular. 

## Features set to achieve
1. Google-based authentication: To prevent clickjacks, and account hacking, and maintain
authentic information of buyers and sellers, we incorporated Google-based authentication to
minimize the possibility of fraudulent accounts.
2. Social-media-like interface: An interface familiar to most people, enabling effective
interaction and more promotion of small businesses.
3. Collaborative filtering: (described above)
4. Content-based filtering: (described above)
